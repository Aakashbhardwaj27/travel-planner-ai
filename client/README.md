Project Report: Travel Planner AI Chatbot
1. Objectives
The objective of this project was to design and implement an AI-powered chatbot that helps users plan their travel efficiently. The chatbot offers recommendations for destinations, hotels, and itineraries using natural language processing powered by OpenAI GPT-4o.
2. Design
The system consists of two main components: a React.js frontend and a Node.js + Express backend. The frontend provides an interactive chat interface using Material UI, while the backend handles requests and integrates with OpenAIâ€™s ChatCompletion API to process natural language queries and generate travel planning responses.
3. Implementation

- Frontend: React.js with Material UI for a modern and responsive chat interface.
- Backend: Node.js and Express server to manage chat history, call OpenAI APIs, and process responses.
- AI Integration: GPT-4o is used to understand user queries and provide relevant travel recommendations.
- Enhancements: Integrated loading indicators, contextual message tracking, and function calling design for future API expansions (e.g., hotel booking APIs).

4. Challenges

- Context Management: Ensuring conversation continuity with dynamic context mapping.
- OpenAI API Quotas: Handling potential request limits and failures from OpenAI.
- UI/UX Design: Creating a chat experience that feels intuitive and seamless with Material UI.
- Future Integration Planning: Designing for scalability to support real-time travel APIs.

5. Lessons Learned

- Importance of UI/UX: A clean, responsive UI greatly enhances user engagement.
- Contextual Memory: Maintaining chat history context is crucial for natural dialogue.
- API Design: Preparing the backend for future extension like OpenAI function calling allows better integration with real-world APIs.
- Full Stack Synergy: Coordinated design between frontend and backend ensures a smoother development cycle.
